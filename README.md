# ServersideFreecam
FabricMC mod to allow the use of spectator mode (Freecam) without being *too* cheaty. No one else made a similar mod so I tried making one, despite literally never having written a single line of java in my life before this. Welcome to the dumpster fire. (This works on serverside without needing a clientside mod, and works on client side as well.)

It follows all of zero (0) java conventions (probably) and has a design worse than a preschooler's first painting, but it runs on 1.17 so i'm happy.
