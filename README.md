# ServersideFreecam
FabricMC mod to allow the use of spectator mode (Freecam) without being *too* cheaty. No one else made a similar mod so I tried making one, albeit literally never having written a single line of java in my life before this. Welcome to the dumpster fire. (This works on serverside without needing a clientside mod, and works on client side as well.)
