# ServersideFreecam
FabricMC mod to allow the use of spectator mode (Freecam) without being *too* cheaty. I couldn't find a similar mod, so I tried making one despite literally never having written a single line of java in my life before this (welcome to the dumpster fire). This mod runs (*ahem*, should run) entirely on the (logical) server, so it should work on both the client's internal server and a dedicated server without any additional client-side mods.

It follows all of zero (0) java conventions (probably) and has a design worse than a preschooler's first drawing, but it runs on 1.17 so I'm happy.

Using Eclipse IDE 2021-06 + Azul Zulu JDK 16.32.15 64bit all on default settings.
